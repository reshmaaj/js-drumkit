# 🥁 Drum Kit

A fun little JavaScript drum kit built using Javascript, HTML and CSS. Tap keys, hear beats, and annoy no one (except yourself). Just DOM things!!

## 🤔 What's this?

This was a **JavaScript DOM practice project** I built while taking a **Full Stack Web Development course on Udemy**.  
Basically, I learned how to make buttons do cool stuff - like making sound - when clicked or when certain keys are pressed.  

## 💡 Features

- Press any of these keys: `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `J`, `K`, `L`
- Or click the on-screen buttons (for the anti-keyboard folks)
- Each button plays a different drum sound
- Buttons briefly animate when triggered, because style matters

## 📚 What I Learned

Here’s what I picked up while building this little jam session:

- 🎯 How to handle **DOM events** (like `click` and `keypress`)
- 🔊 How to use **JavaScript to play audio** with the `Audio` object
- ✨ How to apply and remove **CSS classes dynamically** to animate stuff
- 🔄 How to **loop through elements** and add event listeners

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **HTML** – for the stage  
- **CSS** – for the outfit  
- **JavaScript** – for the magic (and sound)

## 🎮 How to Use

1. Open the webpage.
2. Click any drum button, or press its corresponding key.
3. Jam like no one's watching.
